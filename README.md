## üåü About The Project

`tbf` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the process of finding and working with Twitch VODs (Video on Demand) and clips. Whether you need to generate a direct `m3u8` playlist URL, search for a VOD within a specific timeframe, or extract clips, `tbf` provides a set of powerful and easy-to-use commands to get the job done.

This tool is perfect for researchers, archivists, and anyone who needs programmatic access to Twitch's video content.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Rust**: `tbf` is built with Rust. If you don't have it installed, you can get it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

You can install `tbf` in one of two ways:

#### From Source

If you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can build and install `tbf` directly from the source:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vyneer/tbf
```

#### From Releases

Alternatively, you can download a pre-compiled binary for your operating system from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/vyneer/tbf/releases).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

`tbf` offers several subcommands to perform different actions. Here are some of the most common use cases:

### Interactive Mode

If you're not sure where to start, you can run `tbf` without any arguments to enter an interactive mode that will guide you through the available options.
```bash
tbf
```

### `exact`

Generate and verify a direct `m3u8` URL for a VOD with a known timestamp.
```bash
tbf exact [FLAGS] <username> <id> <timestamp>
```
**Example:**
```bash
tbf exact destiny 39700667438 1605781794
```

### `bruteforce`

Search for a VOD within a given range of timestamps. This is useful when you don't know the exact timestamp of the broadcast.
```bash
tbf bruteforce [FLAGS] <username> <id> <from> <to>
```
**Example:**
```bash
tbf bruteforce destiny 39700667438 1605781694 1605781894
```

### `clipforce`

Scan a VOD to discover all available clips within a specified time range.
```bash
tbf clipforce [FLAGS] <id> <start> <end>
```
**Example:**
```bash
tbf clipforce 39700667438 0 3600
```
